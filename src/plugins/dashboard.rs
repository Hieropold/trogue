//! Plugin for displaying a dashboard of recently played games.
//!
//! <purpose-start>
//! This plugin provides the `dashboard` command, which shows the 10 most recently played games
//! and their achievement progress.
//! <purpose-end>
//!
//! <inputs-start>
//! - `app_context`: The shared application context, providing access to the Steam API client.
//! - `_matches`: The command-line arguments parsed by `clap` (unused in this plugin).
//! <inputs-end>
//!
//! <outputs-start>
//! - A dashboard of recently played games printed to the console.
//! <outputs-end>
//!
//! <side-effects-start>
//! - Makes multiple network requests to the Steam API to fetch game lists and achievement data.
